The approach demodulates an amplitude-modulated (AM) audio signal by first loading and normalizing the signal between 1 and -1, then estimating the carrier frequency using a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to identify the dominant frequency peak. It uses the Hilbert Transform (The Hilbert transform is a mathematical operator used in signal processing that takes a real-valued signal and produces a complex-valued signal, often referred to as the analytic signal, which is useful for extracting instantaneous amplitude and phase information) to extract the signalâ€™s envelope, which represents the original audio content in AM modulation. This envelope is then passed through a low-pass Butterworth filter to remove high-frequency noise and retain only the desired audio frequencies (typically below 5 kHz). Finally, the demodulated signal is normalized and saved as a new audio file, with plots generated to visualize the modulated signal, frequency spectrum, and extracted audio.
